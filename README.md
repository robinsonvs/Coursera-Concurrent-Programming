## Concurrent Programming Coursera #

### _This is the second course in [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization by Rice University in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp)_

An introductory course of  Concurrent Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 
Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
1.	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
2. Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
3.	Atomic variables and isolation
4.	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
5.	Actor model in Java

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. [__Locking and Synchronization__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Concurrent-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week01/miniproject_1)
2. [__Global and Object-Based Isolation__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Concurrent-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week02/miniproject_2)
3. [__Sieve of Eratosthenes Using Actor Parallelism__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Concurrent-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week03/miniproject_3)
4. [__Parallelization of Boruvka's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Concurrent-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week04/miniproject_4)
